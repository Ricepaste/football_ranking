Title: cars pc data: Unrestricted model
DATA: 
	FILE IS '\Users\sharpaste\Documents\program\
	testing\Python\yolo\Mplus\MET_Maydeu-Olivares_web\test.dat';

VARIABLE: 
	NAMES ARE pc1_2-pc1_4 pc2_3-pc2_4 
	pc3_4;

! the names reflect the comparisons performed

	CATEGORICAL = pc1_2-pc1_4 pc2_3-pc2_4 
	pc3_4;

! the data is treated as categorical

ANALYSIS:
	TYPE = MEANSTRUCTURE;
! both thresholds and tetrachoric correlations will be modeled
		
	ESTIMATOR=WLSM;
! DWLS estimation with mean corrected S-B statistic
! for mean and variance corrected S-B use WLSMV instead
	
	PARAMETERIZATION = THETA;
! the program uses a model-based diagonal matrix D to enforce
! the variance standardization

MODEL:
	f1 BY pc1_2-pc1_4@1;
	f2 BY pc2_3-pc2_4@1;
	f3 BY pc3_4@1;
	f2 BY pc1_2@-1 ;
	f3 BY pc1_3@-1 pc2_3@-1 ;
	f4 BY pc1_4@-1 pc2_4@-1 
		pc3_4@-1 ;
	

! this is matrix A, fixed factor loadings

! the factors are 
!		f1 = Citroen AX
!		f2 = Fiat Punto
!		f3 = Nissan Micra
!		f4 = Opel Corsa
!		f5 = Peugeot 106
!		f6 = Seat Ibiza
!		f7 = Volkswagen Polo

	[pc1_2$1-pc3_4$1@0];

! intercepts fixed at zero

	[f1-f3* f4@0];

! the means of first n-1 factors are free, the last mean is fixed at 0

	pc1_2-pc3_4*.1;

! pair specific error specific variances are free (starting value =.1)
! if these variances are to be set all equal use instead
! 	pc12-pc67(1);

! UNRESTRICTED MODEL SPECIFICATION
	f1@1;
	f4@1;
! factor variances for the first and last factors are fixed at 1
! all other factor variances are free parameters
	f2 with f1*;
	f3 with f1-f2*;
	
! factor covariances free except those involving the last object
	f4 with f1-f3@0;

! which are fixed at 0

! CASE 3 MODEL SPECIFICATION
!	f1-f6*;
!	f7@1;
! factor variances are free except for the last one, fixed at 1
!	f2 with f1@0;
!	f3 with f1-f2@0;
!	f4 with f1-f3@0;
!	f5 with f1-f4@0;
!	f6 with f1-f5@0;
!	f7 with f1-f6@0;
! factor covariances fixed at 0

! CASE 5 MODEL SPECIFICATION
!	f1-f7@1;
! factor variances are fixed at 1
!	f2 with f1@0;
!	f3 with f1-f2@0;
!	f4 with f1-f3@0;
!	f5 with f1-f4@0;
!	f6 with f1-f5@0;
!	f7 with f1-f6@0;
! factor covariances fixed at 0

OUTPUT: TECH1; TECH5;
! use TECH1 to verify that the A matrix is properly specified
! use TECH5 to obtain the function minimum (needed for S-B nested tests)
